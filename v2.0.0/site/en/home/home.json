      "Milvus is a cloud-native, open-source vector database built to manage embedding vectors generated by machine learning models and neural networks. It extends the capabilities of best-in-class approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search libraries (e.g. Faiss, NMSLIB, Annoy) and features on-demand scalability, and high availability. The goal of Milvus is to simplify unstructured data management and provide a consistent experience across different deployment environments. Milvus is widely used in different <a href=\"/docs/v2.0.0/overview.md#Applications\">scenarios</a>, and has been adopted by over 1,000 <a href=\"/docs/v2.0.0/milvus_adopters.md\">organizations</a> worldwide.",
